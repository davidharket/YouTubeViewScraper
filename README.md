# YouTubeViewScraper
A web scraper based on selenium that collects the amounts of views each video on the recommended page and turns Norwegian notation for view count (e.g., sett 3,5 mill. ganger) into a corresponding integer.

This project is a proof-of-concept related to web scraping on YouTube. It aims to display that Selenium provides viable solutions for large-scale web scraping on JavaScript-heavy websites. For use with non-norwegian setups, adequate adjusting must be made
